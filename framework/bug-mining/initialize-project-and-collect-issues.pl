=head1 NAME

initialize-project-and-collect-issues.pl -- Configure a new project for
Defects4J, collect all issues from the project issue tracker, and
cross-reference the commit log with the issue numbers known to be bugs.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

initialize-project-and-collect-issues.pl -p project_id -n project_name -w work_dir -r repository_url -g tracker_name -t tracker_project_id -e bug_matching_perl_regexp [-z organization_id] [-q query] [-u tracker_uri] [-l fetching_limit] [-v vcs_type]

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-p C<project_id>>

The id of the new project (e.g., Lang).

=item B<-n C<project_name>>

The (descriptive) name of the new project (e.g., commons-lang).

=item B<-w C<work_dir>>

The working directory for the bug-mining process.

=item B<-r C<repository_url>>

The remote URL of the source code repository for the new project.
TODO: Currently, this has to be a git repository.

=item B<-g C<tracker_name>>

The source control tracker name, e.g., jira, github, google, or sourceforge.

=item B<-t C<tracker_project_id>>

The name used on the issue tracker to identify the project. Note that this might
not be the same as the Defects4j project name / id, for instance, for the
commons-lang project is LANG.

=item B<-z C<organization_id>>

The organization id required for the github issue tracker, it specifies the
organization the repo is under, e.g., apache.

=item B<-q C<query>>

The query sent to the issue tracker. Suitable defaults for supported trackers
are chosen so they identify only bugs.

=item B<-u C<tracker-uri>>

The URI used to locate the issue tracker. Suitable defaults have been chosen for
supported trackers, but you may change it, e.g., point it to a corporate GitHub
URI.

=item B<-l C<fetching_limit>>

The maximum number of issues to fetch at a time. Most issue trackers will limit
the number of results returned by the query, and suitable defaults have been
chosen for each supported tracker.

=item B<-e C<bug_matching_perl_regexp>>

The perl regular expression that will match the issue, e.g., /LANG-(\d+)/mi.

=item B<-v C<vcs_type>>

The version control system: git (default) or svn.
